Uses AutoHotkey and the Chrome Native Applications API to switch the position of your dev tools shelf based on your browser side. Docks to the right on landscape and to the bottom on portrait.

I made this because I have a vertical monitor and a horizontal monitor and I got tired of manually switching the devtools shelf. Currently working on building an installer that fills in registry options so other people can use it. 
If anyone from Google is reading this, add an option in the [chrome.devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/panels) API to set the dock location,
so I can delete this.
